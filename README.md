# Text-Language

 A High-level dynamically-typed language. The language is interpreted using the Text-Language Interpreter (TLI). Although very weird in syntax, coding using text language is very easy.
 For example:

     Hello, World!
     //; This is a comment
 Everything in Text-Language that is not a command is printed to the console without quotes. However, commands execute features like if statements. 
 A demonstration of commands and normal word block:

    //; Word block
    I am cool
    //; Command
    ;add 1+2
 Text-Language is a function-oriented programing language. 
 An example of a function:

    ;define>hi=;add 1+2
    //; cal the function
    ;hi
 An advantage of Text-Language is that everything fits on one line. For example:
 
    ;if>1==1|say hi:;add 1+2
